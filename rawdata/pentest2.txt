  Penetration Testing Phases  
UNDERSTANDING THE FIVE PHASES OF THE PENETRATION TESTING PROCESS
Penetration testing is the process of identifying the security
vulnerabilities in a system or network and trying to exploit them. The
results of penetration tests play a vital role in finding and patching
security flaws.
In this article, we’ll discuss the responsibilities of a penetration
tester and outline the five penetration testing phases, in addition to
looking at some popular penetration testing tools that can be used to
examine systems for vulnerabilities.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF A PENETRATION TESTER
A penetration tester is responsible for finding security
vulnerabilities, including determining which penetration testing
method (Gupta, 2021) is best suited to the situation. This is a
challenging task that requires advanced skills and knowledge.
A penetration tester needs to be familiar with different hacking
techniques and have in-depth network security knowledge. They must
also know how to use various tools to assess the target system’s
security posture.
THE FIVE PHASES OF PENETRATION TESTING
There are five penetration testing phases: reconnaissance, scanning,
vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and reporting. Let’s take a
closer look at the 5 Penetration Testing phases.
RECONNAISSANCE
The first penetration testing phase is reconnaissance. In this phase,
the tester gathers as much information about the target system as they
can, including information about the network topology, operating
systems and applications, user accounts, and other relevant
information. The goal is to gather as much data as possible so that
the tester can plan an effective attack strategy.
Reconnaissance can be categorized as either active or passive
depending on what methods are used to gather information (Braithwaite,
2022). Passive reconnaissance pulls information from resources that
are already publicly available, whereas active reconnaissance involves
directly interacting with the target system to gain information.
Typically, both methods are necessary to form a full picture of the
target’s vulnerabilities.
SCANNING
Once all the relevant data has been gathered in the reconnaissance
phase, it’s time to move on to scanning. In this penetration testing
phase, the tester uses various tools to identify open ports and check
network traffic on the target system. Because open ports are potential
entry points for attackers, penetration testers need to identify as
many open ports as possible for the next penetration testing phase.
This step can also be performed outside of penetration testing; in
those cases, it’s referred to simply as vulnerability scanning and
is usually an automated process. However, there are drawbacks to only
performing a scan without a full penetration test—namely, scanning
can identify a potential threat but cannot determine the level at
which hackers can gain access (Agio, 2022). So, while scanning is
essential for cybersecurity, it also needs human intervention in the
form of penetration testers to reach its full potential.
VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
The third penetration testing phase is vulnerability assessment, in
which the tester uses all the data gathered in the reconnaissance and
scanning phases to identify potential vulnerabilities and determine
whether they can be exploited. Much like scanning, vulnerability
assessment is a useful tool on its own but is more powerful when
combined with the other penetration testing phases.
When determining the risk of discovered vulnerabilities during this
stage, penetration testers have many resources to turn to. One is the
National Vulnerability Database (NVD), a repository of vulnerability
management data created and maintained by the U.S. government that
analyzes the software vulnerabilities published in the Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. The NVD rates the
severity of known vulnerabilities using the Common Vulnerability
Scoring System (CVSS).
EXPLOITATION
Once vulnerabilities have been identified, it’s time for
exploitation. In this penetration testing phase, the penetration
tester attempts to access the target system and exploit the identified
vulnerabilities, typically by using a tool like Metasploit to simulate
real-world attacks.
This is perhaps the most delicate penetration testing phase because
accessing the target system requires bypassing security restrictions.
Though system crashes during penetration testing are rare, testers
must still be cautious to ensure that the system isn’t compromised
or damaged (Basu, 2022).
REPORTING
Once the exploitation phase is complete, the tester prepares a report
documenting the penetration test’s findings. The report generated in
this final penetration testing phase can be used to fix any
vulnerabilities found in the system and improve the organization’s
security posture.
Building a penetration testing report requires clearly documenting
vulnerabilities and putting them into context so that the organization
can remediate its security risks. The most useful reports include
sections for a detailed outline of uncovered vulnerabilities
(including CVSS scores), a business impact assessment, an explanation
of the exploitation phase’s difficulty, a technical risk briefing,
remediation advice, and strategic recommendations (Sharma, 2022).
POPULAR PENETRATION TESTING TOOLS
There are many different penetration testing tools available, and each
has its strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular include:
      NMAP. Nmap is a powerful network scanning tool that can scan for
open ports and services. It also includes features for identifying
vulnerable applications. 
      METASPLOIT. Metasploit is a vulnerability exploitation tool. It
includes a library of exploits for a variety of programs and operating
systems, as well as a wizard that can assist penetration testers in
capitalizing on known vulnerabilities. 
      WIRESHARK. Wireshark is a network analysis tool that can capture
packet data from a network and decode it into readable form. This can
be useful for identifying malicious traffic or sensitive information
being transmitted over a network.
      BURP SUITE. Burp Suite is an all-in-one web application security
testing tool. It can scan websites for vulnerabilities, manipulate
requests and responses, and intercept traffic between the client and
server. 
These are just a few of the many penetration testing tools available
(Aboagye, 2021). As a penetration tester, it’s essential to be
familiar with as many of them as possible so that you can choose the
right tool for each penetration testing phase.
COMMON PENETRATION TESTING MISTAKES
 As with any activity, people make some common mistakes when
performing penetration testing. Some of the most common include: 
      FAILING TO PLAN. Planning is essential for any penetration test.
Without a comprehensive plan, the tester may miss important details,
resulting in unnecessary work and lost time. 
      NOT KNOWING YOUR TOOLS. Knowing which tools to use and how to use
them is essential for any penetration tester. Using the wrong tool for
the job can lead to wasted time and false positives.
      ATTEMPTING TO EXPLOIT THE SYSTEM TOO EARLY. Starting the
exploitation phase before performing adequate reconnaissance can lead
to inaccurate results. The tester needs to understand the target
environment and its vulnerabilities to perform a useful penetration
test. 
      RELYING TOO HEAVILY ON AUTOMATION. Automated tools can be a great
time saver, but they should never be used exclusively. Automated tools
can miss things that human testers would easily find, so it’s
essential to always manually review the results of an automated scan. 
These are just a few of the mistakes people make at various
penetration testing phases. Knowing what they are can help you avoid
them and improve your chances of success.
THE BENEFITS OF PENETRATION TESTING
 There are many benefits to performing penetration testing. Some of
the key ones include: 
      MAINTAINING COMPLIANCE. Many organizations must undergo periodic
penetration tests to comply with laws and regulations like the Payment
Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (Graham, 2021). 
      PREVENTING CYBERATTACKS. One of the main benefits of penetration
testing is finding vulnerabilities in systems. These problems can then
be addressed before hackers exploit them.
      AVOIDING COSTLY SECURITY INCIDENTS. Penetration testing can help
improve an organization’s security posture. Performing penetration
tests helps organizations save money through making themselves less
susceptible to attacks. 
      KEEPING CYBERSECURITY PROFESSIONALS UP TO DATE. To be a successful
penetration tester, it’s essential to keep up with the latest trends
and techniques. Conducting regular penetration tests can also be
beneficial for cybersecurity professionals because it requires them to
stay current on the latest cyberthreats and defense measures. 
LEARNING THE BASICS OF PENETRATION TESTING
Penetration testing is a critical part of information security, and as
more organizations move to the cloud and adopt new technologies, the
need for penetration testers will only increase. By identifying and
fixing vulnerabilities, penetration testers can improve the security
of organizations’ systems and protect their data from hackers.
If you’re a cybersecurity professional, it’s essential to be
familiar with the basics of penetration testing. EC-Council’s
Certified Penetration Testing Professional (C|PENT) program is one of
the most popular and widely recognized certifications in the field.
This certification covers the fundamentals of penetration testing,
including planning, reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, and report
generation.
