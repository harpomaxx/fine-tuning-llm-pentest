Is your organization equipped to defend against the increasing number
of cyberattacks? Penetration testing is one of the best ways to
evaluate your organization’s IT and security infrastructure as it
identifies vulnerabilities in networks and systems. Unpatched
vulnerabilities are an open invitation to cybercriminals. The National
Institute of Standards and Technology discovered 4,068 high-risk
vulnerabilities in 2021 (NIST).
The recent surge in cyberattacks has fueled the demand for penetration
testing. In June 2021, the White House released a memo that urged
businesses to conduct penetration tests to defend against ransomware
threats (The White House, 2021). Security experts need to view
networks and IT infrastructure from the perspective of threat actors
to successfully prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from
cyberattacks. In this blog, we will explore the importance of
penetration testing in depth and learn the role of a penetration
tester.
WHAT IS PEN TESTING?
Penetration testing is a simulated cyberattack that’s used to
identify vulnerabilities and strategize ways to circumvent defense
measures. Early detection of flaws enables security teams to remediate
any gaps, thus preventing data breaches that could cost billions of
dollars otherwise. Pen tests also help assess an organization’s
compliance, boost employee awareness of security protocols, evaluate
the effectiveness of incident response plans, and ensure business
continuity.
National Cyber Security Centre defines a penetration test as a method
for gaining assurance in the security of an IT system by attempting to
breach the system’s security, using the same tools and techniques as
an adversary might (National Cyber Security Centre, 2017). Enterprises
can use the findings from a&nbsp;penetration test&nbsp;to fix vulnerabilities
before a security breach occurs. Penetration testing is a critical
cybersecurity practice across industries, and skilled penetration
testers are in high demand in many domains.
TYPES OF PENETRATION TESTING
 Multiple types of penetration tests are available, each with varying
objectives, requirements, and scope. Let’s dive into the different
forms of penetration testing. 

 SOCIAL ENGINEERING PENETRATION TESTING 
In a social engineering test, testers attempt to trick employees into
giving up sensitive information or allowing the tester access to the
organization’s systems. This enables penetration testers to
understand the organization’s vulnerability to scams or other social
engineering cyberattacks.

 NETWORK PENETRATION TESTING (INTERNAL, EXTERNAL, AND PERIMETER
DEVICES) 
Here, the penetration tester audits a network environment for security
vulnerabilities. Network penetration tests can be further subdivided
into two categories: external tests and internal tests. 
Here, the penetration tester audits a network environment for security
vulnerabilities. Network penetration tests can be further subdivided
into two categories: external tests and internal tests. 
Even though the rise in adoption of cloud and IoT technologies has
blurred the lines of the network perimeter, it is still the first line
of defense. Regular penetration testing of perimeter devices such as
remote servers, routers, desktops, and firewalls can help identify
breaches and weaknesses.

 WEB APPLICATION PENETRATION TESTING 
Web application penetration testing is performed to identify
vulnerabilities in web applications, websites, and web services. Pen
testers assess the security of the code, weaknesses in the
application’s security protocol, and the design. 
This method of pen testing allows companies to meet compliance
requirements and test exposed components like firewalls, DNS servers,
and routers. Because web applications are constantly updated, checking
apps for new vulnerabilities and developing strategies to mitigate
potential threats is crucial.

 WIRELESS PENETRATION TESTING 
With wireless technology becoming nearly omnipresent, businesses must
identify, evaluate, assess, and defend their wireless infrastructures.
Wireless penetration testing identifies security gaps within wireless
access points, such as WiFi networks and wireless devices. Assessors
look for vulnerabilities like weak encryption, Bluetooth exploits,
authentication attacks, and malicious wireless devices to prevent data
breaches.

 IOT PENETRATION TESTING 
IoT penetration testing helps experts uncover security vulnerabilities
in the ever-expanding IoT attack surface. This method helps ensure
security preparedness by finding misconfigurations and fixing them to
make the IoT ecosystem secure. It not only helps prevent security
mishaps but also aids in maintaining regulatory compliance and
minimizing operational disruptions.

 OT PENETRATION TESTING 
As Operational Technology (OT) systems become more connected, they
become more exposed to cyberthreats. Penetration tests detect the
resilience of OT industrial control systems to cyberattacks, provide
visibility, identify vulnerabilities, and prioritize areas of
improvement.

 CLOUD PENETRATION TESTING 
With cloud computing becoming crucial for businesses’ scalability,
organizations must bolster the security of cloud technologies to stay
ahead of cyberattacks. Cloud penetration testing is performed to find
vulnerabilities in a cloud-based environment. Cloud pen tests provide
valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of cloud-based
solutions, enhance incident response programs, and prevent any outward
incidents.

 DATABASE PENETRATION TESTING 
Database security is of utmost importance to organizations as the end
goal of an attacker is to gain access to their databases and steal
confidential information. Database penetration testing checks the
privilege level access to the database. Pen testers attempt to access
your database, identify access points, and afterward, discuss how to
secure your database in the event of a breach.

 SCADA PENETRATION TESTING 
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are a form of
industrial control system that can monitor and control industrial and
infrastructure processes and critical machinery (Cyber Arch, 2021).
SCADA penetration testing is an effective method to secure SCADA
systems from external threats. It helps gain a comprehensive
understanding of any potential risks and security gaps.

 MOBILE DEVICE PENETRATION TESTING 
Given the staggering number of mobile applications available in the
market, they are a lucrative target for malicious actors. A recent
report that analyzed 3,335 mobile apps discovered that 63% of the apps
contained known security vulnerabilities (Synopsys, 2021). Mobile
device penetration testing is essential to the overall security
posture. It helps assess the security of a mobile device and its
applications, discover vulnerabilities, and find flaws in application
code.
PENETRATION TESTING STEPS
 There are five penetration testing steps: reconnaissance, scanning,
vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and reporting. Let’s take a
closer look at each of these phases. 
  penetration-testing-steps  
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER A PENTEST?
Penetration test results, which are usually summarized and analyzed
with a report, help organizations quantify security risks and
formulate action plans. These reports provide a comprehensive view of
a network and its vulnerabilities, enabling companies to remediate
gaps and strengthen their defense, particularly if a report discovers
that a network has been compromised.
Building a penetration testing report requires clearly documenting
vulnerabilities and putting them into context so that the organization
can remediate its security risks. The most useful reports include
sections for a detailed outline of uncovered vulnerabilities
(including CVSS scores), a business impact assessment, an explanation
of the exploitation phase’s difficulty, a technical risk briefing,
remediation advice, and strategic recommendations (Sharma, 2022).
Think of penetration tests as medical check-ups. Consistently checking
the robustness of cybersecurity measures is vital for any business.
Regular assessment ensures that your company can adapt to the ever-
evolving threat landscape.

POPULAR PENETRATION TESTING TOOLS
 To conduct penetration tests, not only do you need skilled pen
testers but also advanced, cutting-edge tools to detect
vulnerabilities. Here’s a list of some of the popular pen testing
tools on the market: 
NMAP
 Nmap (Network Mapper) is an open-source utility tool that can carry
out tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime (Shakreel, 2016). It
uses IP packets to determine what hosts are available on the network,
what services they offer, which operating systems they use, and which
packet filters/firewalls are in use. Nmap supports all major operating
systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS. Nmap integrates an
advanced GUI and various utilities, including Zenmap, Ncat, Ndiff, and
Nping. 
METASPLOIT
 This is an open-source framework with an ever-expanding database of
exploits, enabling pen testers to simulate cyberattacks on networks.
Metasploit uncovers systematic vulnerabilities on networks and
servers. Its open-source framework allows pen testers to use custom
code to find weak points in a network. Metasploit also offers a
customization feature that can be used with most operating systems. 
BURP SUITE PROFESSIONAL

BENEFITS OF PENETRATION TESTING
 In the cyber world, ignorance can be costly and dangerous.
Penetration testing provides critical and actionable information that
allows companies to stay ahead of hackers. Here’s how pen testing
can help scale up your defenses: 

 ADHERENCE TO COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS 
Penetration testing helps organizations meet regulatory requirements
such as PCI DSS, EU GDPR, and ISO 27001. A recent survey revealed that
61% of security leaders listed meeting compliance needs as a factor in
conducting pen tests (Bugcrowd, 2021).

 IDENTIFY AND REMEDIATE VULNERABILITIES 
Penetration tests help identify vulnerabilities that adversaries can
exploit, enabling security personnel to remediate them. Pen testers
present detailed insights into the weaknesses in an IT environment and
recommend policies that can strengthen the security posture. According
to a report, 70% of organizations perform pen tests for vulnerability
management program support (Core Security, 2021).

 ENSURE BUSINESS CONTINUITY 
An organization’s financial loss during a data breach can be
astronomical and disrupt its operations. By conducting penetration
tests, companies gain insight into potential risks, which can help
minimize damages and ensure business continuity.

 ENHANCE CUSTOMER TRUST 
Data breaches can erode customer trust and potentially damage a
company’s reputation. Penetration testing minimizes the risk of
attacks and assures clients and stakeholders that their data is secure
and protected.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF A PENETRATION TESTER
 Now that we’ve covered the benefits, types, tools, and phases of
penetration tests, let’s look at some of the responsibilities of
penetration testers: 
        Conduct threat analysis assessments on applications, network
devices, and cloud infrastructures
