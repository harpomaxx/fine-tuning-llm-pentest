When you opt for an external pentesting solution or service provider,
the entire pentesting process requires collaboration between your
organization and the external security testing team. The terms of this
collaboration are agreed upon in a pre-engagement phase. Let us see
what it covers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PENETRATION TESTING PHASE I: PRE-ENGAGEMENT PHASE 
This is the stage where the logistics and the rules of engagement of
the test are discussed.&nbsp;
The VAPT providers and the target organization can discuss the legal
implications of the exercise. The objective of the test is determined
and the goals of the pentest are aligned with the specific
requirements of a business. You may want to keep certain areas
off-limits for the pentesting team, this is the phase to clarify all
of that.
This is also the time when the scope of the penetration test is
defined.
Determining the scope of the penetration test ensures that both the
target and the tester know what to expect from the test. There are
certain assets that the pentesters are allowed to test, those are
within the scope of the pentest, and others are not. Similarly, the
target organization’s security posture is tested for a predetermined
set of vulnerabilities, anything out of that set is out of scope for
the pentest. The scope of the pentest greatly influences all the
subsequent penetration testing phases.

Let’s talk 
Get started 
PENETRATION TESTING PHASE II : RECONNAISSANCE
In order to simulate a cyber attack on an application or a network,
the pentester needs access to information about the target. They
gather this information in the reconnaissance stage.&nbsp;
Whether a hacker wants to target an entire network or a single web
application, they need to know as much as they can. That is exactly
how a pentester approaches the target. The scoping done in the
previous phase helps the pentester narrow down the recon to increase
efficiency.&nbsp;
There are two kinds of reconnaissance
ACTIVE RECONNAISSANCE
The pentesters engage directly with the target system to gather
information. While this is a more accurate approach to reconnaissance,
it makes more noise since the intruder interacts with the system.
PASSIVE RECONNAISSANCE
In this mode, the intruder does not interact with the target system
and applies different passive strategies instead to gather
information. They can try to eavesdrop on network traffic, trace OS
footprinting or internet footprinting.
When it comes to attacking a web application, mapping is an important
part of the recon operation. This step helps the attacker to look at
all the pieces of the application in one place and form an
understanding of how the app works. An application has many
implemented functionalities and understanding them is crucial for the
success of the subsequent penetration testing phases.
PENETRATION TESTING PHASE III : DISCOVERY
The discovery phase can be divided into two parts:&nbsp;
      Further information gathering
      Vulnerability scan
The first part involves gathering more information about the target
network using a bunch of different techniques. Let us talk about a few
of them.&nbsp;
      Hackers can uncover host-names and IP information using techniques
like DNS interrogation, InterNIC queries, and network sniffing.
      Banner grabbing can be used to uncover application and service
information.
      During an internal test, the tester can uncover system information
such as names and shares using NetBIOS enumeration.
The second part consists of testing the application or the operating
system for known vulnerabilities. You can get an automated scan where
the system is tested against a vulnerability database. Or you can go
for a manual scan where security engineers manually scan the systems.
The latter is more suitable for uncovering new and hidden
vulnerabilities whereas the former is faster.
PENETRATION TESTING PHASE IV : VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
You will discover various threat sources during a security scan. It is
important to tie each of those threat sources to a vulnerability and
then prioritize it depending on the risk it poses to the system.
You need a well defined and consistent process of analyzing the
vulnerabilities in terms of severity and risk. It is the job of a VAPT
provider to analyse the vulnerabilities and create a clear picture for
you to understand and act upon.&nbsp;
While it is difficult to assign an exact number to a vulnerability, a
lot of VAPT companies use a semi quantitative method of rating the
vulnerabilities. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a
globally accepted method of producing a numerical score based on the
severity of a vulnerability.&nbsp;
The CVSS score helps you rate a vulnerability as low, medium, or high
in terms of severity. You can prioritize one vulnerability over others
depending on these factors, when it comes to remediation, the last one
of the Penetration testing phases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The assessment of vulnerabilities is usually performed in line with
various security and risk assessment standards such as the Risk
Assessment Guide for Information Technology Systems by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), ISO 27001, HIPAA, and
more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

PENETRATION TESTING PHASE V : EXPLOITATION AND POST EXPLOITATION
The previous phases prepare the stage for the exploitation phase. The
goal here is establishing access to a system using the loopholes
uncovered in the earlier phases of Pen testing. The pentester tries to
identify an entry point and then look for assets that can be accessed
through that.
The pentesters have to be very careful while conducting this phase to
ensure that the business functionalities are not compromised or
hindered. Nevertheless, system crashes during penetration testing are
very rare.
THE POST EXPLOITATION PHASE
After the pentester has exploited a vulnerability and identified an
entry point to the system the next job is to determine the value of
that entry point. The questions they ponder upon are
      How much access does the entry point yield?
      How easy is it to maintain access?
      How much time may pass before the breach is spotted?
      What is the degree of harm that the vulnerability may cause?
The exploitation and post exploitation phases help the tester gain
access, locate sensitive data, identify communication channels, etc.
They can also try and exploit the connection between different systems
within the network and expand the breach.&nbsp;
The extent to which a pentester may exploit a certain vulnerability is
determined by the rules of engagement agreed upon in the
pre-engagement stage.
PENETRATION TESTING PHASE VI : REPORTING AND RECOMMENDATIONS
All the previous penetration testing phases contribute to this phases
where a VAPT report is created and shared with the client. In the
reporting phase, the pentesters provide detailed information about the
vulnerabilities such as,
      The description of the vulnerabilities.
      Ratings according to a common vulnerability scoring system.
      Severity and impact of vulnerability.
      Risk assessment report.
      Video POCs.
      Recommendations for fixing the vulnerabilities.
The quality of a VAPT report determines how quickly and how
efficiently you will reproduce and remove the vulnerabilities from
your system.
PENETRATION TESTING PHASE VII : REMEDIATION AND RESCAN
The VAPT report consists of step-by-step recommendations for fixing
the vulnerabilities. Your developers can follow those recommendations
to close the gaps in your application security. The VAPT company you
are partnering with for the security testing should help you at every
step of this process.&nbsp;
An ideal remediation phase looks something like this:
      Vulnerabilities are reported with detailed remediation steps.
      There is video based assistance from the security engineers.
      Developers get on a call to discuss the remediation steps when
needed.
Once the vulnerabilities are fixed, the VAPT company should offer
rescans to identify any security loopholes that might have been left
unattended.
HOW MUCH TIME DOES IT TAKE TO COMPLETE ALL THE PHASES OF PENETRATION
TESTING?&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first six penetration test phases, that is from conducting
reconnaissance to producing a VAPT report, should not take more than
10 days. The timeline may vary a little bit based on the scope of the
test.&nbsp;
The timeline for the remediation phase depends upon how quickly your
development team can work on the fixes recommended by the pentesting
team. However, there is usually a stipulated time to avail the free
rescans offered by a VAPT company.&nbsp;&nbsp;
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER ALL SEVEN PENETRATION TESTING PHASES ARE COVERED?
After the vulnerabilities are found and fixed, the VAPT company runs
rescans of your application. If no more vulnerabilities are found in
the rescans, the VAPT company may offer you a successful VAPT
certificate. You can use this certificate to achieve the minimum
requirements of pentesting for achieving regulatory compliances such
as ISO, SOC2, HIPAA, FISMA and many more.

  Penetration Testing Phases  
UNDERSTANDING THE FIVE PHASES OF THE PENETRATION TESTING PROCESS
Penetration testing is the process of identifying the security
vulnerabilities in a system or network and trying to exploit them. The
results of penetration tests play a vital role in finding and patching
security flaws.
In this article, we’ll discuss the responsibilities of a penetration
tester and outline the five penetration testing phases, in addition to
looking at some popular penetration testing tools that can be used to
examine systems for vulnerabilities.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF A PENETRATION TESTER
A penetration tester is responsible for finding security
vulnerabilities, including determining which penetration testing
method (Gupta, 2021) is best suited to the situation. This is a
challenging task that requires advanced skills and knowledge.
A penetration tester needs to be familiar with different hacking
techniques and have in-depth network security knowledge. They must
also know how to use various tools to assess the target system’s
security posture.
THE FIVE PHASES OF PENETRATION TESTING
There are five penetration testing phases: reconnaissance, scanning,
vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and reporting. Let’s take a
closer look at the 5 Penetration Testing phases.
RECONNAISSANCE
The first penetration testing phase is reconnaissance. In this phase,
the tester gathers as much information about the target system as they
can, including information about the network topology, operating
systems and applications, user accounts, and other relevant
information. The goal is to gather as much data as possible so that
the tester can plan an effective attack strategy.
Reconnaissance can be categorized as either active or passive
depending on what methods are used to gather information (Braithwaite,
2022). Passive reconnaissance pulls information from resources that
are already publicly available, whereas active reconnaissance involves
directly interacting with the target system to gain information.
Typically, both methods are necessary to form a full picture of the
target’s vulnerabilities.
SCANNING
Once all the relevant data has been gathered in the reconnaissance
phase, it’s time to move on to scanning. In this penetration testing
phase, the tester uses various tools to identify open ports and check
network traffic on the target system. Because open ports are potential
entry points for attackers, penetration testers need to identify as
many open ports as possible for the next penetration testing phase.
This step can also be performed outside of penetration testing; in
those cases, it’s referred to simply as vulnerability scanning and
is usually an automated process. However, there are drawbacks to only
performing a scan without a full penetration test—namely, scanning
can identify a potential threat but cannot determine the level at
which hackers can gain access (Agio, 2022). So, while scanning is
essential for cybersecurity, it also needs human intervention in the
form of penetration testers to reach its full potential.
VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
The third penetration testing phase is vulnerability assessment, in
which the tester uses all the data gathered in the reconnaissance and
scanning phases to identify potential vulnerabilities and determine
whether they can be exploited. Much like scanning, vulnerability
assessment is a useful tool on its own but is more powerful when
combined with the other penetration testing phases.
When determining the risk of discovered vulnerabilities during this
stage, penetration testers have many resources to turn to. One is the
National Vulnerability Database (NVD), a repository of vulnerability
management data created and maintained by the U.S. government that
analyzes the software vulnerabilities published in the Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. The NVD rates the
severity of known vulnerabilities using the Common Vulnerability
Scoring System (CVSS).
EXPLOITATION
Once vulnerabilities have been identified, it’s time for
exploitation. In this penetration testing phase, the penetration
tester attempts to access the target system and exploit the identified
vulnerabilities, typically by using a tool like Metasploit to simulate
real-world attacks.
This is perhaps the most delicate penetration testing phase because
accessing the target system requires bypassing security restrictions.
Though system crashes during penetration testing are rare, testers
must still be cautious to ensure that the system isn’t compromised
or damaged (Basu, 2022).
REPORTING
Once the exploitation phase is complete, the tester prepares a report
documenting the penetration test’s findings. The report generated in
this final penetration testing phase can be used to fix any
vulnerabilities found in the system and improve the organization’s
security posture.
Building a penetration testing report requires clearly documenting
vulnerabilities and putting them into context so that the organization
can remediate its security risks. The most useful reports include
sections for a detailed outline of uncovered vulnerabilities
(including CVSS scores), a business impact assessment, an explanation
of the exploitation phase’s difficulty, a technical risk briefing,
remediation advice, and strategic recommendations (Sharma, 2022).
POPULAR PENETRATION TESTING TOOLS
There are many different penetration testing tools available, and each
has its strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular include:
      NMAP. Nmap is a powerful network scanning tool that can scan for
open ports and services. It also includes features for identifying
vulnerable applications. 
      METASPLOIT. Metasploit is a vulnerability exploitation tool. It
includes a library of exploits for a variety of programs and operating
systems, as well as a wizard that can assist penetration testers in
capitalizing on known vulnerabilities. 
      WIRESHARK. Wireshark is a network analysis tool that can capture
packet data from a network and decode it into readable form. This can
be useful for identifying malicious traffic or sensitive information
being transmitted over a network.
      BURP SUITE. Burp Suite is an all-in-one web application security
testing tool. It can scan websites for vulnerabilities, manipulate
requests and responses, and intercept traffic between the client and
server. 
These are just a few of the many penetration testing tools available
(Aboagye, 2021). As a penetration tester, it’s essential to be
familiar with as many of them as possible so that you can choose the
right tool for each penetration testing phase.
COMMON PENETRATION TESTING MISTAKES
 As with any activity, people make some common mistakes when
performing penetration testing. Some of the most common include: 
      FAILING TO PLAN. Planning is essential for any penetration test.
Without a comprehensive plan, the tester may miss important details,
resulting in unnecessary work and lost time. 
      NOT KNOWING YOUR TOOLS. Knowing which tools to use and how to use
them is essential for any penetration tester. Using the wrong tool for
the job can lead to wasted time and false positives.
      ATTEMPTING TO EXPLOIT THE SYSTEM TOO EARLY. Starting the
exploitation phase before performing adequate reconnaissance can lead
to inaccurate results. The tester needs to understand the target
environment and its vulnerabilities to perform a useful penetration
test. 
      RELYING TOO HEAVILY ON AUTOMATION. Automated tools can be a great
time saver, but they should never be used exclusively. Automated tools
can miss things that human testers would easily find, so it’s
essential to always manually review the results of an automated scan. 
These are just a few of the mistakes people make at various
penetration testing phases. Knowing what they are can help you avoid
them and improve your chances of success.
THE BENEFITS OF PENETRATION TESTING
 There are many benefits to performing penetration testing. Some of
the key ones include: 
      MAINTAINING COMPLIANCE. Many organizations must undergo periodic
penetration tests to comply with laws and regulations like the Payment
Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (Graham, 2021). 
      PREVENTING CYBERATTACKS. One of the main benefits of penetration
testing is finding vulnerabilities in systems. These problems can then
be addressed before hackers exploit them.
      AVOIDING COSTLY SECURITY INCIDENTS. Penetration testing can help
improve an organization’s security posture. Performing penetration
tests helps organizations save money through making themselves less
susceptible to attacks. 
      KEEPING CYBERSECURITY PROFESSIONALS UP TO DATE. To be a successful
penetration tester, it’s essential to keep up with the latest trends
and techniques. Conducting regular penetration tests can also be
beneficial for cybersecurity professionals because it requires them to
stay current on the latest cyberthreats and defense measures. 
LEARNING THE BASICS OF PENETRATION TESTING
Penetration testing is a critical part of information security, and as
more organizations move to the cloud and adopt new technologies, the
need for penetration testers will only increase. By identifying and
fixing vulnerabilities, penetration testers can improve the security
of organizations’ systems and protect their data from hackers.
If you’re a cybersecurity professional, it’s essential to be
familiar with the basics of penetration testing. EC-Council’s
Certified Penetration Testing Professional (C|PENT) program is one of
the most popular and widely recognized certifications in the field.
This certification covers the fundamentals of penetration testing,
including planning, reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, and report
generation.

Is your organization equipped to defend against the increasing number
of cyberattacks? Penetration testing is one of the best ways to
evaluate your organization’s IT and security infrastructure as it
identifies vulnerabilities in networks and systems. Unpatched
vulnerabilities are an open invitation to cybercriminals. The National
Institute of Standards and Technology discovered 4,068 high-risk
vulnerabilities in 2021 (NIST).
The recent surge in cyberattacks has fueled the demand for penetration
testing. In June 2021, the White House released a memo that urged
businesses to conduct penetration tests to defend against ransomware
threats (The White House, 2021). Security experts need to view
networks and IT infrastructure from the perspective of threat actors
to successfully prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from
cyberattacks. In this blog, we will explore the importance of
penetration testing in depth and learn the role of a penetration
tester.
WHAT IS PEN TESTING?
Penetration testing is a simulated cyberattack that’s used to
identify vulnerabilities and strategize ways to circumvent defense
measures. Early detection of flaws enables security teams to remediate
any gaps, thus preventing data breaches that could cost billions of
dollars otherwise. Pen tests also help assess an organization’s
compliance, boost employee awareness of security protocols, evaluate
the effectiveness of incident response plans, and ensure business
continuity.
National Cyber Security Centre defines a penetration test as a method
for gaining assurance in the security of an IT system by attempting to
breach the system’s security, using the same tools and techniques as
an adversary might (National Cyber Security Centre, 2017). Enterprises
can use the findings from a&nbsp;penetration test&nbsp;to fix vulnerabilities
before a security breach occurs. Penetration testing is a critical
cybersecurity practice across industries, and skilled penetration
testers are in high demand in many domains.
TYPES OF PENETRATION TESTING
 Multiple types of penetration tests are available, each with varying
objectives, requirements, and scope. Let’s dive into the different
forms of penetration testing. 

 SOCIAL ENGINEERING PENETRATION TESTING 
In a social engineering test, testers attempt to trick employees into
giving up sensitive information or allowing the tester access to the
organization’s systems. This enables penetration testers to
understand the organization’s vulnerability to scams or other social
engineering cyberattacks.

 NETWORK PENETRATION TESTING (INTERNAL, EXTERNAL, AND PERIMETER
DEVICES) 
Here, the penetration tester audits a network environment for security
vulnerabilities. Network penetration tests can be further subdivided
into two categories: external tests and internal tests. 
Here, the penetration tester audits a network environment for security
vulnerabilities. Network penetration tests can be further subdivided
into two categories: external tests and internal tests. 
Even though the rise in adoption of cloud and IoT technologies has
blurred the lines of the network perimeter, it is still the first line
of defense. Regular penetration testing of perimeter devices such as
remote servers, routers, desktops, and firewalls can help identify
breaches and weaknesses.

 WEB APPLICATION PENETRATION TESTING 
Web application penetration testing is performed to identify
vulnerabilities in web applications, websites, and web services. Pen
testers assess the security of the code, weaknesses in the
application’s security protocol, and the design. 
This method of pen testing allows companies to meet compliance
requirements and test exposed components like firewalls, DNS servers,
and routers. Because web applications are constantly updated, checking
apps for new vulnerabilities and developing strategies to mitigate
potential threats is crucial.

 WIRELESS PENETRATION TESTING 
With wireless technology becoming nearly omnipresent, businesses must
identify, evaluate, assess, and defend their wireless infrastructures.
Wireless penetration testing identifies security gaps within wireless
access points, such as WiFi networks and wireless devices. Assessors
look for vulnerabilities like weak encryption, Bluetooth exploits,
authentication attacks, and malicious wireless devices to prevent data
breaches.

 IOT PENETRATION TESTING 
IoT penetration testing helps experts uncover security vulnerabilities
in the ever-expanding IoT attack surface. This method helps ensure
security preparedness by finding misconfigurations and fixing them to
make the IoT ecosystem secure. It not only helps prevent security
mishaps but also aids in maintaining regulatory compliance and
minimizing operational disruptions.

 OT PENETRATION TESTING 
As Operational Technology (OT) systems become more connected, they
become more exposed to cyberthreats. Penetration tests detect the
resilience of OT industrial control systems to cyberattacks, provide
visibility, identify vulnerabilities, and prioritize areas of
improvement.

 CLOUD PENETRATION TESTING 
With cloud computing becoming crucial for businesses’ scalability,
organizations must bolster the security of cloud technologies to stay
ahead of cyberattacks. Cloud penetration testing is performed to find
vulnerabilities in a cloud-based environment. Cloud pen tests provide
valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of cloud-based
solutions, enhance incident response programs, and prevent any outward
incidents.

 DATABASE PENETRATION TESTING 
Database security is of utmost importance to organizations as the end
goal of an attacker is to gain access to their databases and steal
confidential information. Database penetration testing checks the
privilege level access to the database. Pen testers attempt to access
your database, identify access points, and afterward, discuss how to
secure your database in the event of a breach.

 SCADA PENETRATION TESTING 
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are a form of
industrial control system that can monitor and control industrial and
infrastructure processes and critical machinery (Cyber Arch, 2021).
SCADA penetration testing is an effective method to secure SCADA
systems from external threats. It helps gain a comprehensive
understanding of any potential risks and security gaps.

 MOBILE DEVICE PENETRATION TESTING 
Given the staggering number of mobile applications available in the
market, they are a lucrative target for malicious actors. A recent
report that analyzed 3,335 mobile apps discovered that 63% of the apps
contained known security vulnerabilities (Synopsys, 2021). Mobile
device penetration testing is essential to the overall security
posture. It helps assess the security of a mobile device and its
applications, discover vulnerabilities, and find flaws in application
code.
PENETRATION TESTING STEPS
 There are five penetration testing steps: reconnaissance, scanning,
vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and reporting. Let’s take a
closer look at each of these phases. 
  penetration-testing-steps  
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER A PENTEST?
Penetration test results, which are usually summarized and analyzed
with a report, help organizations quantify security risks and
formulate action plans. These reports provide a comprehensive view of
a network and its vulnerabilities, enabling companies to remediate
gaps and strengthen their defense, particularly if a report discovers
that a network has been compromised.
Building a penetration testing report requires clearly documenting
vulnerabilities and putting them into context so that the organization
can remediate its security risks. The most useful reports include
sections for a detailed outline of uncovered vulnerabilities
(including CVSS scores), a business impact assessment, an explanation
of the exploitation phase’s difficulty, a technical risk briefing,
remediation advice, and strategic recommendations (Sharma, 2022).
Think of penetration tests as medical check-ups. Consistently checking
the robustness of cybersecurity measures is vital for any business.
Regular assessment ensures that your company can adapt to the ever-
evolving threat landscape.

POPULAR PENETRATION TESTING TOOLS
 To conduct penetration tests, not only do you need skilled pen
testers but also advanced, cutting-edge tools to detect
vulnerabilities. Here’s a list of some of the popular pen testing
tools on the market: 
NMAP
 Nmap (Network Mapper) is an open-source utility tool that can carry
out tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime (Shakreel, 2016). It
uses IP packets to determine what hosts are available on the network,
what services they offer, which operating systems they use, and which
packet filters/firewalls are in use. Nmap supports all major operating
systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS. Nmap integrates an
advanced GUI and various utilities, including Zenmap, Ncat, Ndiff, and
Nping. 
METASPLOIT
 This is an open-source framework with an ever-expanding database of
exploits, enabling pen testers to simulate cyberattacks on networks.
Metasploit uncovers systematic vulnerabilities on networks and
servers. Its open-source framework allows pen testers to use custom
code to find weak points in a network. Metasploit also offers a
customization feature that can be used with most operating systems. 
BURP SUITE PROFESSIONAL
 Burp Suite Professional is one of the leading tools for web security
testing. Its advanced manual and automated features help identify the
top ten vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP. Burp Suite allows
assessors to generate and confirm clickjacking attacks for potentially
vulnerable web pages. It lets you alter all HTTP(S) communications
passing through your browser and find hidden attack surfaces. 
OWASP-ZAP
 Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP), maintained under the Open Web Application
Security Project (OWASP), is a free, open-source penetration testing
tool instrumental in testing web applications. It intercepts and
inspects messages sent between the browser and web application, alters
them, and sends them to their destination. OWASP-ZAP is flexible and
extensible, meaning it can be used as a stand-alone application and as
a daemon process. 
HYDRA
 Hydra is one of the most effective pen testing tools for performing
password and brute force attacks. It is a parallelized login cracker
that supports numerous protocols to attack. It’s very fast,
flexible, and easy to add new modules to Hydra (KALI, 2022). 
WIRESHARK
 This is one of the most widely used network protocol analyzers that
helps thoroughly scan network traffic. Wireshark conducts a thorough
inspection of hundreds of protocols, which gets updated periodically.
It has live capture and an offline analysis feature. Wireshark is a
multi-platform tool that can run on Windows, Linux, macOS, Solaris,
FreeBSD, and NetBSD. It can integrate the most powerful display
filters available in the industry and offers rich VoIP analysis.
Penetration testers can browse the captured network data via a GUI or
a TTY-mode TShark utility. 
JOHN THE RIPPER
This tool is free, open-source software that helps crack passwords.
John the Ripper offers several password-cracking modes and can be
configured to meet the user’s requirements. Though it was originally
designed for the Unix operating system, it now supports 15 platforms,
most of which are Windows, DOS, and OpenVMS versions. The jumbo
version of John the Ripper supports hundreds of hash and cipher types,
including user passwords of Unix, macOS, Windows, web apps, groupware,
database servers, and many more.

BENEFITS OF PENETRATION TESTING
 In the cyber world, ignorance can be costly and dangerous.
Penetration testing provides critical and actionable information that
allows companies to stay ahead of hackers. Here’s how pen testing
can help scale up your defenses: 

 ADHERENCE TO COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS 
Penetration testing helps organizations meet regulatory requirements
such as PCI DSS, EU GDPR, and ISO 27001. A recent survey revealed that
61% of security leaders listed meeting compliance needs as a factor in
conducting pen tests (Bugcrowd, 2021).

 IDENTIFY AND REMEDIATE VULNERABILITIES 
Penetration tests help identify vulnerabilities that adversaries can
exploit, enabling security personnel to remediate them. Pen testers
present detailed insights into the weaknesses in an IT environment and
recommend policies that can strengthen the security posture. According
to a report, 70% of organizations perform pen tests for vulnerability
management program support (Core Security, 2021).

 ENSURE BUSINESS CONTINUITY 
An organization’s financial loss during a data breach can be
astronomical and disrupt its operations. By conducting penetration
tests, companies gain insight into potential risks, which can help
minimize damages and ensure business continuity.

 ENHANCE CUSTOMER TRUST 
Data breaches can erode customer trust and potentially damage a
company’s reputation. Penetration testing minimizes the risk of
attacks and assures clients and stakeholders that their data is secure
and protected.
