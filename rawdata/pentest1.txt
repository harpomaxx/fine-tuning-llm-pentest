When you opt for an external pentesting solution or service provider,
the entire pentesting process requires collaboration between your
organization and the external security testing team. The terms of this
collaboration are agreed upon in a pre-engagement phase. Let us see
what it covers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PENETRATION TESTING PHASE I: PRE-ENGAGEMENT PHASE 
This is the stage where the logistics and the rules of engagement of
the test are discussed.&nbsp;
The VAPT providers and the target organization can discuss the legal
implications of the exercise. The objective of the test is determined
and the goals of the pentest are aligned with the specific
requirements of a business. You may want to keep certain areas
off-limits for the pentesting team, this is the phase to clarify all
of that.
This is also the time when the scope of the penetration test is
defined.
Determining the scope of the penetration test ensures that both the
target and the tester know what to expect from the test. There are
certain assets that the pentesters are allowed to test, those are
within the scope of the pentest, and others are not. Similarly, the
target organization’s security posture is tested for a predetermined
set of vulnerabilities, anything out of that set is out of scope for
the pentest. The scope of the pentest greatly influences all the
subsequent penetration testing phases.

Let’s talk 
Get started 
PENETRATION TESTING PHASE II : RECONNAISSANCE
In order to simulate a cyber attack on an application or a network,
the pentester needs access to information about the target. They
gather this information in the reconnaissance stage.&nbsp;
Whether a hacker wants to target an entire network or a single web
application, they need to know as much as they can. That is exactly
how a pentester approaches the target. The scoping done in the
previous phase helps the pentester narrow down the recon to increase
efficiency.&nbsp;
There are two kinds of reconnaissance
ACTIVE RECONNAISSANCE
The pentesters engage directly with the target system to gather
information. While this is a more accurate approach to reconnaissance,
it makes more noise since the intruder interacts with the system.
PASSIVE RECONNAISSANCE
In this mode, the intruder does not interact with the target system
and applies different passive strategies instead to gather
information. They can try to eavesdrop on network traffic, trace OS
footprinting or internet footprinting.
When it comes to attacking a web application, mapping is an important
part of the recon operation. This step helps the attacker to look at
all the pieces of the application in one place and form an
understanding of how the app works. An application has many
implemented functionalities and understanding them is crucial for the
success of the subsequent penetration testing phases.
PENETRATION TESTING PHASE III : DISCOVERY
The discovery phase can be divided into two parts:&nbsp;
      Further information gathering
      Vulnerability scan
The first part involves gathering more information about the target
network using a bunch of different techniques. Let us talk about a few
of them.&nbsp;
      Hackers can uncover host-names and IP information using techniques
like DNS interrogation, InterNIC queries, and network sniffing.
      Banner grabbing can be used to uncover application and service
information.
      During an internal test, the tester can uncover system information
such as names and shares using NetBIOS enumeration.
The second part consists of testing the application or the operating
system for known vulnerabilities. You can get an automated scan where
the system is tested against a vulnerability database. Or you can go
for a manual scan where security engineers manually scan the systems.
The latter is more suitable for uncovering new and hidden
vulnerabilities whereas the former is faster.
PENETRATION TESTING PHASE IV : VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
You will discover various threat sources during a security scan. It is
important to tie each of those threat sources to a vulnerability and
then prioritize it depending on the risk it poses to the system.
You need a well defined and consistent process of analyzing the
vulnerabilities in terms of severity and risk. It is the job of a VAPT
provider to analyse the vulnerabilities and create a clear picture for
you to understand and act upon.&nbsp;
While it is difficult to assign an exact number to a vulnerability, a
lot of VAPT companies use a semi quantitative method of rating the
vulnerabilities. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a
globally accepted method of producing a numerical score based on the
severity of a vulnerability.&nbsp;
The CVSS score helps you rate a vulnerability as low, medium, or high
in terms of severity. You can prioritize one vulnerability over others
depending on these factors, when it comes to remediation, the last one
of the Penetration testing phases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The assessment of vulnerabilities is usually performed in line with
various security and risk assessment standards such as the Risk
Assessment Guide for Information Technology Systems by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), ISO 27001, HIPAA, and
more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

PENETRATION TESTING PHASE V : EXPLOITATION AND POST EXPLOITATION
The previous phases prepare the stage for the exploitation phase. The
goal here is establishing access to a system using the loopholes
uncovered in the earlier phases of Pen testing. The pentester tries to
identify an entry point and then look for assets that can be accessed
through that.
The pentesters have to be very careful while conducting this phase to
ensure that the business functionalities are not compromised or
hindered. Nevertheless, system crashes during penetration testing are
very rare.
THE POST EXPLOITATION PHASE
After the pentester has exploited a vulnerability and identified an
entry point to the system the next job is to determine the value of
that entry point. The questions they ponder upon are
      How much access does the entry point yield?
      How easy is it to maintain access?
      How much time may pass before the breach is spotted?
      What is the degree of harm that the vulnerability may cause?
The exploitation and post exploitation phases help the tester gain
access, locate sensitive data, identify communication channels, etc.
They can also try and exploit the connection between different systems
within the network and expand the breach.&nbsp;
The extent to which a pentester may exploit a certain vulnerability is
determined by the rules of engagement agreed upon in the
pre-engagement stage.
PENETRATION TESTING PHASE VI : REPORTING AND RECOMMENDATIONS
All the previous penetration testing phases contribute to this phases
where a VAPT report is created and shared with the client. In the
reporting phase, the pentesters provide detailed information about the
vulnerabilities such as,
      The description of the vulnerabilities.
      Ratings according to a common vulnerability scoring system.
      Severity and impact of vulnerability.
      Risk assessment report.
      Video POCs.
      Recommendations for fixing the vulnerabilities.
The quality of a VAPT report determines how quickly and how
efficiently you will reproduce and remove the vulnerabilities from
your system.
PENETRATION TESTING PHASE VII : REMEDIATION AND RESCAN
The VAPT report consists of step-by-step recommendations for fixing
the vulnerabilities. Your developers can follow those recommendations
to close the gaps in your application security. The VAPT company you
are partnering with for the security testing should help you at every
step of this process.&nbsp;
An ideal remediation phase looks something like this:
      Vulnerabilities are reported with detailed remediation steps.
      There is video based assistance from the security engineers.
      Developers get on a call to discuss the remediation steps when
needed.
Once the vulnerabilities are fixed, the VAPT company should offer
rescans to identify any security loopholes that might have been left
unattended.
HOW MUCH TIME DOES IT TAKE TO COMPLETE ALL THE PHASES OF PENETRATION
TESTING?&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first six penetration test phases, that is from conducting
reconnaissance to producing a VAPT report, should not take more than
10 days. The timeline may vary a little bit based on the scope of the
test.&nbsp;
The timeline for the remediation phase depends upon how quickly your
development team can work on the fixes recommended by the pentesting
team. However, there is usually a stipulated time to avail the free
rescans offered by a VAPT company.&nbsp;&nbsp;
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER ALL SEVEN PENETRATION TESTING PHASES ARE COVERED?
After the vulnerabilities are found and fixed, the VAPT company runs
rescans of your application. If no more vulnerabilities are found in
the rescans, the VAPT company may offer you a successful VAPT
certificate. You can use this certificate to achieve the minimum
requirements of pentesting for achieving regulatory compliances such
as ISO, SOC2, HIPAA, FISMA and many more.
